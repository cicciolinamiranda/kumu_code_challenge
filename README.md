## Technology Stack
* Java
* Android

DB
* Offline Storage Using Room


Architectural Pattern
* Model-View-ViewModel

Libraries
* Room
* Retrofit

## Folder Structure
### Under `src/main`
* `java` contains Java source codes
* `res` contains all images, xmls and drawables

### Under `src/main/java`

* `com.example.kumu.data` contains classes that interact or represent the data layer.
    * `db` - domain data models for the ORM. (i.e. classes that represent the DB tables).
    * `repository` - classes that abstract the DAO as repositories. These classes represent results as collections of entities. Hence the name 'repository'.
    * `dto` - data transfer objects that carries data between processes.
    * `exception` - custom global Exception class that is being use by the app.

* `com.example.kumu.api` contains the classes that will be use for API calls.

* `com.example.kumu.util` contains utility classes for that application (e.g. mapping domain models to resources).

* `com.example.kumu.viewmodel` contains the viewmodels which is the mediator from the view to the business logic.

* `com.example.kumu.view` contains all view clases such as activities, adapters and the like.
